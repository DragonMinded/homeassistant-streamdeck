A simple utility for displaying switches on a StreamDeck. Requires a Home Assistant installation running somewhere, a Long-Lived Access Token issued from your profile on Home Assistant, and a configuration file containing the list of switch entities you want to display. This was not made as a Home Assistant add-on because it is intended to be run on a separate device driving a StreamDeck, possibly mounted to a wall or in a room. I recommend using a Raspberry Pi or a Rock Pi S to drive the StreamDeck using this code.
